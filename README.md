# Breast Cancer Prediction and Survival Analysis 🎗️

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling breast cancer data to perform:

- **Classification**: Predict whether a patient is *Alive* or *Dead* (`Mortality_Status`)  
- **Regression**: Estimate *Survival Months* for patients who were diagnosed

The project follows the end-to-end machine learning pipeline using real-world data and includes ensemble learning, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretable tree models.
